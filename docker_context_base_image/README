I Cannot upload the IntelliJ IDE tarball since it's too big.
You have to download it yourself. I used version ideaIC-2020.3.1.tar.gz
but you can use another version and pass it using ..

docker build --build-arg IJ_TARBALL=ideaIC-${YOUR_VERSION}.tar.gz -t ${YOUR_TAG} .

to build your docker image.


Make sure you place the tarball in the same directory as the Dockerfile and build.sh
if you choose to build the image yourself.

Either way, the best way to get this image is from my DockerHub account at ..
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mvpjava/

When you actually execute the run.sh script in the top level directory, it will
fetch it for you.
